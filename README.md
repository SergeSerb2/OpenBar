OpenBar is a lightweight fork of [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) by Peter Steinberger. It keeps
CodexBar's features — usage limits, reset countdowns, credits, local cost scans, and 100+ providers — and focuses on
keeping the app small in memory.

## Why OpenBar

CodexBar can use a lot of memory on machines with large local agent histories. On one Mac with 1.8 GB of Codex
session logs, a long-running CodexBar used 247 MB and had peaked at 1.9 GB, and its offscreen ChatGPT dashboard page
spawned a 300–520 MB web process about every 25 minutes. OpenBar targets **under 100 MB** in steady state and
**never above 200 MB**.

Measured on one Mac (macOS 27.2) with the same scripted scenario — open the menu and cycle tabs, open Settings on
Usage & Spend, close it, force a refresh, reopen the menu, idle — Codex and Claude enabled with local cost tracking
(1.8 GB of Codex logs). Footprint is what Activity Monitor shows as Memory. Medians of 3 runs.

| | CodexBar code | OpenBar |
|---|---:|---:|
| Idle after startup scans | 165 MB | 70–100 MB |
| Settled after the scenario | 190 MB (worst 451 MB) | 110 MB |
| Peak during the scenario | 383 MB (worst 618 MB) | ~260 MB |
| App memory during a Codex cost scan | 133 MB | 14 MB |
| ChatGPT dashboard page loads (300–520 MB web process each) | every 25 min | at most every 6 h |

The remaining peak comes from about 100 MB of GPU memory that macOS allocates while the menu is open; it is released
when the menu closes, and reducing it is the next step.

What changed, in short:

- **Cost scans run in a short-lived helper.** Codex and Claude log scans, cache reads, and catch-up passes run in the
  bundled `openbar` CLI as a child process (`openbar __cost-worker`). The app receives only the finished results, and
  all scan memory goes back to macOS when the helper exits. If the helper is missing or fails, the app falls back to
  scanning in process.
- **The ChatGPT dashboard page loads at most every 6 hours.** Usage limits still refresh through the API on every
  cycle. A manual refresh or missing history still loads the page.
- **Decoded caches do not linger.** The Codex scan baseline is released after 90 seconds idle, the Claude fragment
  cache keeps 32 MiB instead of 512 MiB, and the allocator returns freed pages after each scan.
- **Closed windows let go of their content.** Settings, inspectors, and chart submenus release their view trees when
  closed and keep only navigation state; hidden spend-dashboard detail is released after 1 minute.

Cost totals are checked against golden outputs from the original code on a frozen copy of real logs, both in process
and through the helper, so the numbers you see do not change.

## Install

OpenBar has no signed binary releases yet. Build it from source (requires macOS 14+ and Xcode with Swift 6.2+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SergeSerb2/OpenBar.git
cd OpenBar
./Scripts/package_app.sh        # builds OpenBar.app with ad-hoc signing
open OpenBar.app
```

OpenBar uses its own bundle ID (`com.serbinenko.openbar`), settings, caches, and config file
(`~/.config/openbar/config.json`), so it can run next to CodexBar without sharing state.

### Memory scenario probe (for contributors)

Launch the app with `OPENBAR_MEMORY_PROBE_DIR=/some/dir` to run a scripted scenario: it opens the menu and cycles
every tab, opens and closes Settings on Usage & Spend, forces a refresh, reopens the menu, and logs the physical
footprint at each step to `events.csv`. The probe is inert unless that variable is set.

### macOS first run
- Open Settings → Providers and enable what you use.
- Install/sign in to the provider sources you rely on: CLIs, browser sessions, OAuth/device flow, API keys, local app files, or provider apps depending on the provider.
- Optional: Settings → Providers → Codex → OpenAI cookies (Automatic or Manual) to add dashboard extras.

### Set API keys from the CLI
Provider toggles and API keys live in the resolved OpenBar config file. New installs use
`~/.config/openbar/config.json`; existing `~/.openbar/config.json` installs still load from the legacy path. You can
script the same provider list that Settings → Providers uses:

```bash
openbar config providers
openbar config enable --provider grok
openbar config disable --provider cursor
```

For API-key providers, store a key without opening Settings:

```bash
printf '%s' "$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" | openbar config set-api-key --provider elevenlabs --stdin
```

`set-api-key` trims the piped value, stores it with restrictive config-file permissions, and enables the provider by default. Use `--no-enable` to only save the key, or `--api-key <key>` for one-off local scripts where shell history is not a concern.

## Icon & Screenshot
The menu bar icon is a tiny usage meter. Bar meaning is provider-specific, and errors/stale data can dim the icon or
show an incident indicator.

## Features
- Multi-provider menu bar with per-provider toggles (Settings → Providers).
- Provider-specific usage meters with reset countdowns.
- Optional Codex web dashboard enrichments (code review remaining, usage breakdown, credits history).
- Inline spend and usage charts for API-backed providers such as OpenAI, Claude Admin API, OpenRouter, LiteLLM, z.ai, MiniMax, Mistral, and AWS Bedrock.
- Codex and Claude Plan Usage menus show a quota burndown from recorded snapshots, with the capture time and an even-use guide. The existing utilization history remains below it, and the line fills in as the app collects samples.
- Configurable cost-usage scans for Codex + Claude, plus reused chart UI for supported provider histories. Codex history uses a WAL-enabled SQLite store capped at 25,000 retained session entries and 256 MiB.
- A persistent Settings → Usage & Spend view for local estimates, grouped by native currency and provider. Each provider shows its accounts or history sources alongside its model breakdown; project/session views and daily/hourly trends share compact selectors. Incomplete history stays labeled, and source, privacy, export, and sharing controls remain available.
- Provider status polling with incident badges in the menu and icon overlay.
- Merge Icons mode to combine providers into one status item + switcher. With **Icon + Percent** and two enabled built-in providers, choose **Stacked** to show their first layout lines together. Automatic rows follow provider order and reserve explicit choices; disabling a selected provider uses a fallback and restores the saved choice when re-enabled. The dropdown menu stays available, and each provider keeps its own layout settings.
- Display controls for provider icons, labels, bars, reset-time style, and highest-usage auto-selection.
- Fresh installs default to Adaptive refresh. Existing users keep every valid stored choice, while legacy unset or
  invalid preferences resolve to 5 minutes. Manual and fixed 1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, and 30m alternatives remain available.
- Bundled CLI (`openbar`) for scripts and CI (including `openbar cost --provider codex`, `claude`, or `both` for local cost usage); macOS and Linux CLI builds available.
- WidgetKit widgets for supported providers.
- Localized app and website with a shared 23-language catalog, automatic website detection, persistent pickers, and RTL support.
- Optional session quota notifications and weekly-reset confetti.
- Privacy-first: on-device parsing by default; browser cookies are opt-in and reused (no passwords stored).

## Privacy note
Wondering if OpenBar scans your disk? It doesn’t crawl your filesystem; it reads a small set of known locations (browser cookies/local storage, provider config files, local JSONL logs) when the related features are enabled. Plain Adaptive refresh never inspects local agent activity. The separate Adaptive (agent-aware) option asks before inspecting the running-process list (including command lines) to identify Codex/Claude and reading bounded known-session metadata. Declining returns to plain Adaptive. When allowed with Agent Sessions hidden, OpenBar retains only the latest activity time and discards session paths and identities. Provider tokens and token-account settings live in the OpenBar config file with restrictive file permissions. See the discussion and audit notes in [issue #12](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/12).

## macOS permissions (why they’re needed)
- **Full Disk Access (optional)**: only required to read Safari cookies/local storage for web-based providers. If you don’t grant it, use another supported browser, manual cookies/API keys, OAuth, or CLI/local sources where that provider supports them.
- **Keychain access (prompted by macOS)**:
  Chromium cookie import needs the browser’s Safe Storage item, and an explicitly enabled Claude OAuth repair may
  read Claude Code’s own Keychain item. Background OpenBar paths fail or skip instead of requesting authorization;
  a user-initiated import or repair can still show the macOS prompt. **Settings → Advanced → Disable Keychain
  access** blocks OpenBar-owned Keychain operations and browser decryption, but cannot constrain provider-owned CLIs
  that OpenBar launches. Manual cookie headers, API keys, and file-backed sources remain alternatives where
  supported. See [Keychain prompts](docs/keychain-prompts.md) for Allow Once vs. Always Allow, recurring grants, and
  safe troubleshooting.
- **Files & Folders prompts (folder/volume access)**: OpenBar launches provider CLIs and local probes for some providers. If those helpers read a project directory or external drive, macOS may ask OpenBar for that folder/volume (e.g., Desktop or an external volume). This is driven by the helper’s working directory, not background disk scanning.
- **What we do not request in the background**: no Screen Recording or Accessibility permissions; user-triggered helper actions may ask macOS for Automation permission to open Terminal. No passwords are stored (browser cookies are reused when you opt in).

## Getting started (dev)
- Clone the repo and open it in Xcode or run the scripts directly.
- Launch once, then toggle providers in Settings → Providers.
- Install/sign in to provider sources you rely on (CLIs, browser cookies, OAuth/device flow, API keys, or local app/config files).
- Optional: set OpenAI cookies (Automatic or Manual) for Codex dashboard extras.

## Build from source
Requires macOS 14+ and Swift 6.2+.

```bash
./Scripts/package_app.sh        # builds OpenBar.app in-place with ad-hoc signing
open OpenBar.app
```

Dev loop:
```bash
./Scripts/compile_and_run.sh
./Scripts/compile_and_run.sh --test  # also run the sharded test suite before packaging/relaunching
make check                           # SwiftFormat + SwiftLint
make docs-list                       # list docs with frontmatter summaries
```

CLI install:
```bash
# after installing OpenBar.app in /Applications
./bin/install-openbar-cli.sh
```

## Ecosystem

CodexBar has a large set of community integrations (Linux desktop apps, panel widgets, desk displays, phone apps).
They target CodexBar's `codexbar` CLI and JSON output; OpenBar's CLI is named `openbar` and keeps the same JSON
shape. See [CodexBar's README](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar#related) for the current list.

## Credits

OpenBar is a fork of [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) by Peter Steinberger
([@steipete](https://github.com/steipete)), and keeps its features, providers, and docs.
Cost tracking was inspired by [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) (MIT).
