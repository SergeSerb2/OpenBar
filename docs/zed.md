# Zed provider

OpenBar monitors Zed plan status, billing cycle dates, edit-prediction quota, and overdue invoices via Zed's cloud API.
Optional browser billing adds token spend, its spending limit, and remaining budget.

## Data source

**Browser billing (opt-in)** — in Zed provider settings, change **Cookie source** from **Off** to **Auto** to import a
browser session in the shared browser order, or **Manual** to paste a Cookie request header. Sign in to `zed.dev` in a supported browser first; signing in only
inside the editor does not create this browser session. OpenBar requests:

```text
GET https://cloud.zed.dev/frontend/billing/usage
Cookie: zed.session=...
```

The bundled JavaScript plugin maps `current_usage.token_spend.spend_in_cents` and `limit_in_cents` to USD, with the
response's plan and edit-prediction usage. A missing limit remains unknown. Browser billing uses only that browser
account; it does not combine its spend with editor identity or custom-server data. Expired sessions and response-format
changes produce a clear error instead of fabricated totals. This is an undocumented frontend contract, based on the
[endpoint evidence in #3172](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/issues/3172).

**Off** keeps the editor source below. The CLI uses that source by default; an explicit `--source api` always selects it.
For manual browser billing, configure `cookieSource: "manual"` and `cookieHeader` for Zed in the CLI config, then select
`--source web`. Automatic browser import requires macOS. Explicit web mode never falls back to editor credentials.

**Local probe (Keychain + cloud API)** — reads the same credentials Zed stores after GitHub sign-in, then calls:

```text
GET https://cloud.zed.dev/client/users/me
Authorization: {user_id} {access_token}
```

### Keychain credentials

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Service URL | `https://zed.dev` by default, or the configured HTTPS `server_url` for a custom server |
| Keychain class | **Internet password** (`kSecClassInternetPassword`, server = service URL). Generic-password fallback is supported for older layouts. |
| Account | Zed user ID (string) |
| Secret | Access token (UTF-8 bytes) |

OpenBar requests a non-interactive Keychain read. Existing Zed items can still carry an access-control list that makes
macOS show a SecurityAgent prompt the first time OpenBar reads them. Choose **Always Allow** to avoid repeat prompts. If
Zed has never been signed in, or access is denied, the provider reports **Not signed in to Zed**.

### Settings override

OpenBar reads Zed’s user settings from `~/.config/zed/settings.json`. The `credentials_url` setting (falls back to
`server_url`) selects which Keychain entry to read. For the trusted
`https://zed.dev` and `https://staging.zed.dev` servers, Zed may use a separate credential identifier. Custom servers
must use HTTPS and store credentials under the exact same `server_url`; OpenBar rejects cross-origin overrides so a
settings-file change cannot forward a Keychain token to another host.

## Snapshot mapping

| Zed field | OpenBar display |
| --- | --- |
| `plan.plan_v3` | Plan label (Free / Pro / Trial / Student / Business) |
| `plan.usage.edit_predictions` | Primary bar: used/limit or “Unlimited” on Pro+ |
| `plan.subscription_period.ended_at` | Billing cycle reset / secondary window |
| `plan.has_overdue_invoices` | Warning note + billing window marker |

## Limitations

### Not tracked as “Zed”

Per [LLM Providers](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers.html) and [External Agents](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents.html):

- BYOK models → track via OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.
- External agents (Claude Agent, Codex ACP) → bill through those providers

## Troubleshooting

### “Not signed in to Zed”
- Sign in from the **Zed editor app** (Command Palette → `client: sign in`).
- Confirm a Keychain internet-password entry exists for server `https://zed.dev` (or your custom `credentials_url`).

### “Could not read Zed credentials from the Keychain”
- macOS may block Keychain access until you allow OpenBar (same class of issue as other IDE probes).
- Re-sign in to Zed after changing `credentials_url`.
