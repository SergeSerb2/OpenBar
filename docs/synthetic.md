# Synthetic provider

Synthetic is API-key only. OpenBar reads the quota endpoint and maps the
known Synthetic quota lanes into the shared provider card.

## Authentication

Create an API key using [Synthetic's API guide](https://dev.synthetic.new/docs/api/getting-started), then add it in
Settings -> Providers -> Synthetic, or set:

```bash
export SYNTHETIC_API_KEY="..."
```

You can also store the key through the CLI:

```bash
printf '%s' "$SYNTHETIC_API_KEY" | openbar config set-api-key --provider synthetic --stdin
```

## Data source

OpenBar sends a read-only request to [Synthetic's quota API](https://dev.synthetic.new/docs/synthetic/quotas):

```http
GET https://api.synthetic.new/v2/quotas
Authorization: Bearer <api key>
Accept: application/json
```

The parser first looks for Synthetic's known quota slots, either at the root
of the response or under `data`:

- `rollingFiveHourLimit` -> Five-hour quota
- `weeklyTokenLimit` -> Weekly tokens
- `search.hourly` -> Search hourly

If those keys are absent, OpenBar falls back to generic quota payloads such as
`quotas`, `quota`, `limits`, `usage`, `entries`, or `subscription`.

## Display

- The menu card shows the five-hour, weekly token, and search-hourly lanes when present. The compact menu bar metric
  uses the five-hour or weekly lane.
- Usage is normalized from percent fields when present, or computed from used/remaining/limit values.
- Reset timestamps are shown when Synthetic returns one. When no timestamp is available, OpenBar uses the returned
  or inferred window duration when present.
- Plan name, when returned, is displayed as provider identity context.
- Synthetic does not currently provide OpenBar cost history.
- External status page: [status.synthetic.new](https://status.synthetic.new) (not linked or auto-polled by OpenBar).

## CLI usage

```bash
openbar usage --provider synthetic
openbar usage --provider synthetic.new
```
